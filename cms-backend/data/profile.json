    "full": "With 6+ years of experience in RFPs, tenders, grants, and business development, I bridge the gap between technical teams, pricing strategists, and client stakeholders to deliver customized, winning proposals. Whether it's a government TOR, a donor-funded RFQ, or a competitive NGO grant, I bring structure, strategy, and speed to every bid cycle.\n\nI specialize in:\n\n• Managing full bid lifecycles for complex service proposals\n• Writing compelling narratives in both English and Arabic\n• Aligning financial justifications with technical value\n• Designing and automating internal proposal systems\n• Coaching junior writers and building scalable bid units\n\nWhat sets me apart?\n\nI don't just submit proposals—I build pipelines, tell winning stories, and drive measurable results. I've increased win rates by 150%, improved internal workflows by 35%, and helped organizations shift from reactive bidding to proactive growth.\n\nCurrently leading the Proposals Department at EYouth, I work on regional bids for digital transformation, capacity building, training, and managed services.\n\nLet's connect if you're looking for someone who knows how to turn an RFP into a strategic growth opportunity."
